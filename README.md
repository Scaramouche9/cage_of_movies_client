Overview:
This app contains information about various Nicolas Cage movies including director info, genre info, ratings, and release year. Users can register and deregister and add and delete favorite movies to and from their list.

Tools used:
This app was built using HTML5, SCSS, and JavaScript ES6 languages. I used:
-Parcel to complete my build process, including transpilation, minification, bundling, and auto-prefixing

Future plans:
I intend to create a front end user interface for this API using React.
